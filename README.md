# Data science FAQ

This is a personal list of data science questions with their answers

## Data

- Latent variables: are variables that are not directly observed but are rather inferred (through a mathematical model) from other variables that are observed (directly measured). Example: result of a PCA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable
- One hot encoding: vector with all 0 but one 1. Example: [0, 0, 1, 0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot

## Feature engineering

### Calculate feature importance

- Random forest ([example](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html))
- Take feature out and check accuracy or Gini values ([example](http://alexperrier.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/08/27/feature-importance-random-forests-gini-accuracy.html))
